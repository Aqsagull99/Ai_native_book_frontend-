## Prompt

```
$ARGUMENTS
```

## Response snapshot

Completed implementation planning for the personalization feature. Created:

1. Implementation plan (plan.md) with technical context, constitution check, and project structure
2. Research document (research.md) with technical decisions and rationale
3. Data model (data-model.md) with database schema for personalization preferences and bonus points
4. API contracts (contracts/personalization-api.yaml) in OpenAPI format
5. Quickstart guide (quickstart.md) with setup instructions
6. Updated agent context to include new technologies

The plan covers the full stack implementation needed to allow users to personalize chapter content via a button click and earn bonus points, with proper authentication, data storage, and API design.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Comprehensive implementation plan created for personalization feature with all necessary design artifacts
- 🧪 Tests: null
- 📁 Files: Created plan.md, research.md, data-model.md, quickstart.md, and API contracts
- 🔁 Next prompts: /sp.tasks to generate implementation tasks
- 🧠 Reflection: The plan addresses all requirements from the specification with proper database design, API contracts, and frontend integration while maintaining compliance with project constitution.
