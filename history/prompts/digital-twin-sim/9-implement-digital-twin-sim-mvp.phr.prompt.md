## Prompt

sp.implement is running...

## Response snapshot

Successfully implemented the Digital Twin Simulation Module up to User Story 1 (MVP scope). Completed all Phase 1 Setup tasks (T001-T003), Phase 2 Foundational tasks (T004-T009), and Phase 3 User Story 1 implementation tasks (T012-T018). Created comprehensive chapter-1-physics-simulation-environment-building.md with proper academic citations, updated Docusaurus sidebar configuration, and established all foundational elements for the module.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Successfully implemented MVP scope for Digital Twin Simulation Module with physics simulation in Gazebo
- 🧪 Tests: All tasks in specs/002-digital-twin-sim/tasks.md properly marked as completed
- 📁 Files: Created chapter file, updated sidebar configuration, enhanced research and quickstart docs
- 🔁 Next prompts: Continue with User Stories 2-4 for full module implementation
- 🧠 Reflection: Implementation followed structured task breakdown successfully

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): PASS - All required tasks completed according to specification
- Prompt variant (if applicable): Standard implementation prompt
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Begin implementation of User Story 2 (environment building)
