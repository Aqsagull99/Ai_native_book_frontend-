# Create Digital Twin Simulation Spec

## User Input

```
Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)

## Title
**Module 2 — The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)**
*Simulating humanoid robots and their environments for physics, rendering, and sensor integration.*

## Target Audience
- CS, AI, and Robotics students
- Learners familiar with Python/ROS 2 and humanoid robot control

## Learning Focus
- Building physics-based simulation environments
- Understanding Gazebo for physics, collisions, and gravity
- High-fidelity visualization and human-robot interaction in Unity
- Sensor simulation: LiDAR, Depth Cameras, IMUs

## Scope (What This Module Covers)
1. **Physics Simulation in Gazebo**
   - Gravity, collisions, and robot-environment interactions
2. **Environment Building**
   - Constructing scenes, objects, and obstacles
3. **Unity Rendering & HRI**
   - High-fidelity visualizations and human-robot interaction scenarios
4. **Sensor Simulation**
   - LiDAR, Depth Cameras, IMUs, and perception pipelines

## Deliverables

```

## Response Summary

Created a comprehensive specification for the Digital Twin Simulation Module covering Gazebo and Unity simulation. The specification includes:

- 4 prioritized user stories covering the core learning objectives for CS, AI, and Robotics students
- 10 functional requirements with clear acceptance criteria
- 8 measurable success criteria focused on student outcomes
- Properly defined key entities (Gazebo Simulation Environment, Unity Rendering System, Humanoid Robot Models, Sensor Simulation Data, Environment Objects)
- Identified edge cases for different learning scenarios
- Complete validation checklist confirming quality standards

The specification follows all project requirements including Flesch-Kincaid Grade 10-12 writing level, APA citations, and compatibility with Docusaurus and academic documentation standards.

## Outcome

The Digital Twin Simulation Module specification is complete and ready for the planning phase. The specification captures all requirements for creating 4 chapters covering physics simulation in Gazebo, environment building, Unity rendering and HRI, and sensor simulation for humanoid robots.

## Evaluation

The specification successfully addresses all requirements from the user input. It maintains focus on user value and learning objectives while providing clear, testable requirements. The validation checklist confirms all quality standards are met, with no implementation details leaking into the specification and all success criteria being technology-agnostic and measurable.
