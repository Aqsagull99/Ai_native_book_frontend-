## User Input

$ARGUMENTS

## Response Summary

Generated comprehensive task breakdown for the Digital Twin Simulation Module (Gazebo & Unity) with 54 total tasks organized across 7 phases:

- Phase 1: 3 Setup tasks for project initialization
- Phase 2: 6 Foundational tasks for blocking prerequisites
- Phase 3: 7 tasks for User Story 1 (Physics Simulation in Gazebo) - Priority P1
- Phase 4: 7 tasks for User Story 2 (Environment Building in Gazebo) - Priority P2
- Phase 5: 7 tasks for User Story 3 (Unity Rendering & HRI) - Priority P3
- Phase 6: 7 tasks for User Story 4 (Sensor Simulation) - Priority P4
- Phase 7: 9 tasks for Polish & Cross-Cutting concerns

Each task follows the required format with checkboxes, sequential IDs (T001-T054), parallel markers [P] where appropriate, and user story labels [US1-US4] for story-specific tasks. The tasks are organized to enable independent implementation and testing of each user story, with clear file paths and dependencies documented.

## Outcome

The tasks.md file is complete and ready for execution. The task breakdown enables both sequential implementation following priority order (P1-P4) and parallel execution where tasks are marked with [P]. Each user story can be implemented and validated independently, with User Story 1 serving as the suggested MVP scope.

## Evaluation

The task breakdown successfully maps all requirements from the specification and plan documents. All content areas (Gazebo physics simulation, environment building, Unity rendering, sensor simulation) are covered with specific implementation tasks. The organization supports both individual and team-based development approaches with clear dependencies and parallel execution opportunities identified.
