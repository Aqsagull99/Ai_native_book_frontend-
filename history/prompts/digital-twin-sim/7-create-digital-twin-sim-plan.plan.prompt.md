# Create Digital Twin Sim Plan

## User Input

```
Module 2 — The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)

## Title
**Module 2 — The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)**
*Physics, rendering, and sensor simulation for humanoid robots.*

## Create
- **Flow:** Gazebo physics → Environment setup → Unity rendering/HRI → Sensor simulation (LiDAR, Depth, IMU)
- **Chapters & Sidebar:**
  1. Physics Simulation & Environment Building
  2. Simulating Physics, Gravity & Collisions
  3. High-Fidelity Rendering & Human-Robot Interaction
  4. Simulating Sensors: LiDAR, Depth Cameras, IMUs

## Research Approach
- Research-concurrent: Gazebo/Unity docs + robotics simulation papers (APA)

## Quality Validation
- Run Gazebo & Unity examples
- Verify sensor outputs
- Sidebar renders in Docusaurus

## Decisions
- Physics vs. rendering detail
- Sensor fidelity: simple vs realistic

## Testing
- Gazebo simulations execute correctly
- Unity HRI scenes load
- Sensor data accurate
- APA citations, readability, no plagiarism

## Technical Details
- Phases: Research → Foundation → Analysis → Synthesis
It’s short, clear, and ready to use.
```

## Response Summary

Created comprehensive implementation plan for the Digital Twin Simulation Module (Gazebo & Unity). The plan includes:

- Detailed technical context covering Gazebo/Unity integration, ROS 2 dependencies, and simulation requirements
- Constitution check ensuring compliance with project principles (primary source verification, academic clarity, reproducibility, peer-reviewed sources, traceability, APA citations)
- Project structure with clear documentation and source code organization
- Implementation phases covering research, content creation, integration, and validation
- Key dependencies and risk analysis
- Success criteria verification checklist

The plan follows a 10-day timeline with 4 phases: Research (Days 1-2), Content Creation (Days 3-6), Integration (Days 7-8), and Validation (Days 9-10). Each phase has specific deliverables and validation steps to ensure the module meets all requirements.

## Outcome

The implementation plan is complete and ready for execution. It provides a clear roadmap for creating the 4-chapter Digital Twin simulation module with proper integration into the Docusaurus documentation site, while ensuring all content meets academic standards and technical requirements.

## Evaluation

The implementation plan successfully addresses all requirements from the user input. It maintains compliance with the project constitution by incorporating primary source verification, academic clarity, reproducibility, and proper citation standards. The plan provides a realistic timeline with appropriate phases and includes validation steps to ensure quality outcomes.
