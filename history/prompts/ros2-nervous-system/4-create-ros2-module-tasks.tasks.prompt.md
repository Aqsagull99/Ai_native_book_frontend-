## Response Summary

Generated comprehensive task breakdown for the ROS 2 Nervous System Module with 54 total tasks organized across 7 phases:

- Phase 1: 3 Setup tasks for project initialization
- Phase 2: 7 Foundational tasks for blocking prerequisites
- Phase 3: 8 tasks for User Story 1 (Understanding ROS 2 as Middleware) - Priority P1
- Phase 4: 8 tasks for User Story 2 (ROS 2 Communication Patterns) - Priority P2
- Phase 5: 9 tasks for User Story 3 (AI Agent Integration) - Priority P3
- Phase 6: 10 tasks for User Story 4 (URDF for Humanoids) - Priority P4
- Phase 7: 9 Polish & Cross-Cutting tasks for validation

Each task follows the required format with checkboxes, sequential IDs (T001-T054), parallel markers [P] where appropriate, and user story labels [US1-US4] for story-specific tasks. The tasks are organized to enable independent implementation and testing of each user story, with clear file paths and dependencies documented.

## Outcome

The tasks.md file is complete and ready for execution. The task breakdown enables both sequential implementation following priority order (P1-P4) and parallel execution where tasks are marked with [P]. Each user story can be implemented and validated independently, with User Story 1 serving as the suggested MVP scope.

## Evaluation

The task breakdown successfully maps all requirements from the specification and plan documents. All content areas (ROS 2 middleware, communication patterns, AI integration, URDF modeling) are covered with specific implementation tasks. The organization supports both individual and team-based development approaches with clear dependencies and parallel execution opportunities identified.
