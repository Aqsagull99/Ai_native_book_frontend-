## Prompt

sp.implement is running…

## Response snapshot

Successfully completed full implementation of Vision-Language-Action (VLA) module with 4 comprehensive chapters covering LLMs & Robotics Convergence, Voice-to-Action with Whisper, Cognitive Planning with LLMs, and Capstone Project: Autonomous Humanoid. Created all required documentation files, updated sidebar navigation, implemented voice processing pipeline, LLM cognitive planning systems, and complete ROS 2 action execution integration. All 54 tasks from tasks.md completed across 7 phases: Setup, Foundational, User Story 1-4, and Polish phases. Module now fully functional with proper APA citations, word counts within specifications, and complete system integration examples.

## Outcome

- ✅ Complete VLA module implementation with 4 chapters
- ✅ All technical components: Whisper voice recognition, LLM planning, ROS 2 execution
- ✅ Documentation system with Docusaurus integration and sidebar navigation
- ✅ All tasks completed (T001-T054) across all 7 phases
- 📚 Educational content ready for CS/AI/Robotics students

## Evaluation

The implementation successfully delivered all requirements from the specification including voice recognition with OpenAI Whisper, cognitive planning with LLMs, and ROS 2 action sequences for humanoid robots. All four user stories implemented with comprehensive code examples, proper academic citations, and integration patterns. The module meets educational standards with Grade 10-12 readability and proper word counts. Ready for deployment in educational curriculum.
