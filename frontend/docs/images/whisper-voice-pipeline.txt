[Audio Preprocessing]
      ↓
[Whisper Speech Recognition]
      ↓
[Text Transcription]

```

## Detailed Pipeline Steps

1. **Human Voice**: Natural language command spoken by user
2. **Audio Input**: Captured via microphone or audio device
3. **Audio Preprocessing**: Noise reduction, normalization, format conversion
4. **Whisper Speech Recognition**: Converts speech to text with confidence scores
5. **Text Transcription**: Clean text representation of spoken command
6. **Natural Language Understanding**: Parse meaning and intent from text
7. **Command Interpretation**: Map natural language to robot actions
8. **Robot Action Planning**: Generate sequence of executable actions
9. **ROS 2 Action Execution**: Execute planned actions on robot
10. **Robot Response**: Physical action or feedback to user
