# LLM Planning Workflow Diagram

## Diagram Description

The LLM Planning Workflow shows the process from natural language command to robot action execution:

```
[Natural Language Command]
         ↓
[LLM Prompt Engineering]
         ↓
[Context Integration]
         ↓
[Plan Generation]
         ↓
[Action Sequence Validation]
         ↓
[ROS 2 Action Execution]
         ↓
[Feedback & Monitoring]
```

## Detailed Workflow Steps

1. **Natural Language Command**: User provides high-level goal in natural language
2. **LLM Prompt Engineering**: Structured prompt with context and constraints
3. **Context Integration**: Environmental state, robot capabilities, constraints
4. **Plan Generation**: LLM generates step-by-step action sequence
5. **Action Sequence Validation**: Safety and feasibility checks
6. **ROS 2 Action Execution**: Execute actions through ROS 2 interface
7. **Feedback & Monitoring**: Execution status and environment updates

## Alternative Visualization

```
Input → Processing → Output
Goal → LLM Planning → Action Sequence → Robot Execution
```

## Planning Loop

The workflow operates in a loop where feedback influences future planning decisions:

```
[New Command] ──→ [Plan] ──→ [Execute] ──→ [Monitor]
    ↑                                         │
    └────────── [Feedback & Update Context] ←──┘
