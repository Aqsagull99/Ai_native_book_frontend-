# Quickstart Guide: Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Book

## Getting Started

This quickstart guide provides an overview of how to approach the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics book and begin your learning journey.

### Prerequisites

Before starting the book, ensure you have:
- Basic understanding of AI and robotics concepts
- Familiarity with programming (Python preferred)
- Access to a computer capable of running robotics simulations (minimum 16GB RAM recommended)

### Book Structure Overview

The book is organized into 7 main chapters over a 13-week learning plan:

1. **Introduction to Physical AI** - Understanding AI systems in the real physical world
2. **Embodied Intelligence Overview** - Principles of AI systems integrated with physical bodies
3. **Hardware & Lab Setup** - Setting up your digital twin workstation and robot lab
4. **Weekly Learning Plan** - 13 weeks of structured learning content
5. **Assessments** - ROS 2 package assignments, Gazebo simulation tasks, Isaac projects
6. **Capstone Overview** - Simulated humanoid robot with conversational AI
7. **References** - Comprehensive APA-formatted citations

### Week-by-Week Breakdown

**Weeks 3-5: ROS 2**
- Install and configure ROS 2 (Humble Hawksbill)
- Learn ROS 2 fundamentals: nodes, topics, services, actions
- Create your first ROS 2 packages and nodes

**Weeks 6-7: Gazebo & Unity (Digital Twin)**
- Set up Gazebo simulation environment
- Learn Unity for digital twin visualization
- Create your first simulated robot environment

**Weeks 8-10: NVIDIA Isaac**
- Install and configure NVIDIA Isaac

- Complete the capstone project

### Hardware Setup Options

Choose one of three lab tiers based on your budget and requirements:

**Proxy Tier (Simulation Only)**
- Digital twin workstation: 16GB RAM, i5 processor or better
- Software only: ROS 2, Gazebo, Unity
- Perfect for initial learning

**Miniature Tier (Small Robots)**
- Digital twin workstation: 32GB RAM, i7 processor or better
- NVIDIA Jetson Orin for edge AI
- Intel RealSense for depth sensing
- Small mobile robot platform

**Premium Tier (Full Humanoid)**
- High-performance workstation: 64GB RAM, i9 processor or better
- NVIDIA RTX 3080 or better for simulation
- Full humanoid robot platform
- Complete sensor and actuator suite

### Essential Tools

You'll need to install these tools before starting:

1. **ROS 2 Humble Hawksbill** - Robot Operating System
2. **Gazebo** - Physics simulation environment
3. **Unity** - Digital twin visualization
4. **NVIDIA Isaac** - AI perception and planning
5. **Git** - Version control for code examples
6. **Python 3.8+** - Programming language for examples

### Reading Strategy

1. Read each chapter completely before attempting exercises
2. Follow the practical examples in your own environment
3. Complete the weekly assignments to reinforce learning
4. Keep track of citations and references for deeper exploration
5. Build toward the capstone project incrementally

### Success Metrics

By the end of the 13 weeks, you should be able to:
- Explain principles of embodied intelligence
- Set up and configure a complete robotics development environment
- Implement perception, planning, and action systems
- Create a simulated humanoid robot with conversational AI
- Understand the workflow from simulation to real-world deployment
