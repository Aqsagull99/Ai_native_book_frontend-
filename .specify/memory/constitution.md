# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics — Spec-Driven Book + Integrated RAG Chatbot + Personalization System Constitution

## Core Principles

### Accuracy through primary source verification
All robotics, AI, ML, control systems, and architecture claims must be verified using primary sources and official documentation.

### Clarity for an academic audience
Content must be understandable to readers with a computer science background, written at a Flesch-Kincaid Grade 10–12 level.

### Reproducibility
All examples, RAG pipelines, API calls, diagrams, and implementations must be reproducible and correctly reflect working code.

### Rigor (peer-reviewed sources preferred)
At least 50% of references must be peer-reviewed robotics/AI/HCI research papers or textbooks.

### Traceability
All factual claims must be directly traceable to cited sources.

### Citation Format
APA style for all academic, technical, and documentation citations.

## Key Standards

Source Requirements (Minimum 15 credible sources, At least 50% peer-reviewed), Plagiarism Policy (0% tolerance for plagiarism of any form), Writing Quality (Clear, structured, academic writing).

## Development Workflow

Use Docusaurus for the book, Use Spec-Kit Plus for all specifications and project structure, Use FastAPI for backend, Qdrant for embeddings, and Neon Postgres for user/auth data, Use TypeScript + React for UI components, All diagrams must accurately reflect the implemented pipeline.

## Governance

All PRs/reviews must verify compliance with primary source verification, Academic writing standards must be maintained, All factual claims must include proper citations in APA format, Book content must meet the 5,000-7,000 word count requirement, RAG chatbot must be fully integrated and functional, Bonus features (auth, personalization, translation) are optional but follow the same standards.
